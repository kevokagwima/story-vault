  <h2>About Story Vault</h2>
  <p>Inspired by my love for storytelling and the desire to create a platform where everyone can share their
    narratives, I embarked on this journey in early 2025. The idea blossomed during a personal experience where I
    found solace in sharing my own stories with friends. This project is not just a coding assignment; it's a passion
    project that aims to foster community and connection.</p>
  <p>This is a Portfolio Project for ALX. You can view the project repository <a
      href="https://github.com/your-repo-link">here</a>.</p>
